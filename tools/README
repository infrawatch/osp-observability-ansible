Template generater
==================

This tool is used to create config templates and defaults file for the
collectd_config role. Currently works only for simple configs (i.e. only
string in the config params)

This tool is intended for developers to use when adding a new plugin template
for the collectd_config ansible role. The user should add info about the plugin
and its parameters, and use this to generate the template, instead of creating
them by hand. The changes to plugin_options.yaml, along with the generated
templates in ``roles/collectd_config/templates/<plugin>.conf.yml`` should be
committed.

The script reads a yaml file which has options for each plugin, whether
the options are mandatory and what the default value is.
e.g.
  my_plugin:
    config1:
      mandatory: true
      default: "my_default_value"
    config2:
      mandatory: false
      default: "some_other_value"

The script then generates a config template (to go under
collectd_config/templates/<plugin>.conf.j2 and a defaults file (for
collectd_config/main/<plugin>.yml

If a plugin option is non mandatory, but sets a default, the option is written
to the defaults file and commented out to show as an example.

If the plugin has a set of configs, and none of them set defaults, outputs will
not be parsable, as the defaults file will be functionally blank (i.e. only
contains comments, and subsequent config generation in collectd_config will
fail. Avoid this by using the ``set_defaults: false`` option for the plugin.


Usage::

  python template_generator.py

Limitations
-----------
* Only simple configs (string, bool or list) are supported at the moment;
  complex, nested configs are not understood
